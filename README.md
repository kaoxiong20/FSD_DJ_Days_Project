# FSD DJ Days Project

Create a project that holds some of your favorite albums!

#### Note:
Refer back to the pet directory in-class demo for ideas...

## Instructions

In this repository you have several pre-made files where you will work on your project. You will not need to touch *index.html* or *stylesheet.css*

You will create a website that will serve as your DJ album list. If there are less than 10 albums, the website will show a message to tell you that you need more albums. If there are 10 albums or more, the website will let you know that you're ready to start playing music!

## *albums.js*
In this file, you will create an array of 5 'album' objects. Each object should have the following properties: 
- "name"
- "artist"
- "genre".

Optionally, you can also add an "artwork" property with an image of the album cover.

#### Note:

- Remember to test the functionality to see that the correct messaging appears if there are 10 albums

## *albumListing.js*
- In this file, you will create a "for loop" that will list all of the albums in *albums.js*
- If there are less than 10 albums, an *<h4>* message should be populated in the header that says "You need more albums!"
- Otherwise, an *<h4>* message should be populated in the header that says "Let's start playing music!"

#### Notes:

- You already have the variable *"html"* that can be used to create the album listings for the DOM, as well as the code to produce whatever content the variable *"html"* has
- The *<h4>* message variables have also been included

# Stretch Goal:
- Add logic to your project to denote whether or not an album in *albums.js* is one of your top three favorite albums
- You will have to add to both *albums.js* and *albumListings.js* to make this work

## Getting Started
Make sure to fork this project into your own Github account, and clone it down to start working on it! 

## Commands to Remember: Saving your work 

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "(Whatever message you want in here)"
git push
```

### More to Come... 

We will be adding more to this project, so please have the base of this project done by this Wednesday before class. Thanks!
